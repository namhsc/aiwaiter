## ðŸ”„ Context-Aware System

Quick Actions **automatically change** based on cart state:

### Empty Cart
```
[Menu] [Popular] [Specials] [Vegetarian] [Discounts] [Recommend]
```
**Goal:** Encourage exploration and discovery

### Cart Has Items (1-2)
```
[Bill] [Desserts] [Drinks] [Discounts] [Checkout] [My cart]
```
**Goal:** Complete order with add-ons

### Active Ordering (3+)
```
[My cart] [Bill] [Drinks] [Desserts] [Discounts] [Checkout]
```
**Goal:** Review and checkout

---

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

### User Flow
```
1. User sees button: "Schnitzel"
2. User clicks button
3. System expands: "I would like to order the Wiener Schnitzel, please."
4. Message sent to AI
5. AI responds: "Excellent! Added Wiener Schnitzel to your cart..."
```

### Technical Flow
```typescript
// 1. User clicks Quick Action
handleQuickReply("Schnitzel")

// 2. Expansion happens
expandQuickAction("Schnitzel")
// â†’ "I would like to order the Wiener Schnitzel, please."

// 3. Message sent to chat
handleSendMessage(expandedPhrase)

// 4. AI processes and responds
generateAIResponse(expandedPhrase, cart)
```
